                If you're like many homeowners today, you're interested in beautifying your garden 
                with fewer chemicals and more diverse plants. The great news is it's never been easier to introduce 
                hearty, native plants into your own yard.</p>
              <p>
                If you're planning garden updates, you probably know pollinators play an important 
                role in the health and beauty of the plants you choose. Honey bees around the world are dying off 
                at alarming rates, but you can help them by choosing indigenous plants. Since these plants grow 
                in your region anyway, they're great natural food sources for bees.</p>
              <p>
                It doesn't take any extra work on your part to help bees and other pollinators. In fact, native plants 
                use less water and are more climate tolerant. The fascinating bees, butterflies, and birds they attract 
                are a beautiful bonus Mother Nature throws in free of charge!</p>
              <p> 
                Bee-Z Street is designed to help you choose easy-care native plants that brighten and beautify your home landscaping. 
                We think you'll love the results; the bees will thank you too!
